## Insights
- The `LoginController` class is responsible for handling login requests.
- The `login` method processes the login request and returns a token if the credentials are valid.
- The `LoginRequest` class represents the structure of the login request payload.
- The `LoginResponse` class represents the structure of the login response payload.
- The `Unauthorized` class is used to handle unauthorized access attempts.
